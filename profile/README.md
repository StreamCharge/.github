## Digital service provision and usage for everyone

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Welcome! 

StreamCharge is a technology company based in the Czech Republic, founded to bring micropayments
to digital service providers and consumers of all types. 

Today the world is rapidly transitioning to new types of financial infrastructure and legislative frameworks that create new opportunities
to own, distribute and consume digital content, data feeds, online services and more, for humans and AI's alike.

The Stablecoin economy is being built as we speak. High volume international, cheap transaction settlement already exists. Laws now allow you to 
produce your own digital content and services without the need for payment gateway interaction: host, provide, sell. For consumers, all you
need, or should need, is digital Dollars, digital Euros or the electronic funds of your choice, to be able to purchase news, audio, video, ML model
access, data feeds, all without the hassle of registrations, monthly subscriptions, or sharing payment card details.

Moreover, when access is purchased for certain qualities of service, both the consumer and the provider need guarantees that pricing changes can go
ahead without affecting the quality of service promised in the original purchase.

StreamCharge is producing a platform of technologies, protocols and apps to enable that vision. 
- üñ•Ô∏è ‚òÅÔ∏è Easily host your services without technical know-how, price them and monetize them. Distribute them privately or publicly on the ApiCharge catalogue. 
- üë• üì± Browse and buy with ease: pay as you go, pay all year, pay per use, no need for subscriptions and no need to share your credit card.

This github organisation contains the public groups for user feedback and discussions. ApiCharge is the main project with the server binaries,
public B2B/desktop apps, and apicharge Docker images. Others will come later for consumer apps such as StreamCharge content players and app plugins.

We thank you for joining StreamCharge and the ApiCharge project.
